Description: OpenSSH user/password GUI dialog for LXQt
 This module handles openssh security password access for LXQt. The openssh
 askpass module, will perform security test over scale access privileges.
 .
 The LXQt modules are desktop independent tools, and operate as daemons for the
 local user for desktop specific operations.
 .
 LXQt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt
 technologies, ships several core desktop components, all of which are
 optional:
 .
  * Panel
  * Desktop
  * Application launcher
  * Settings center
  * Session handler
  * Polkit handler
  * SSH password access (this)
  * Display manager handler
 .
 These components perform similar actions to those available in other
 desktop environments, and their names are self-descriptive. They are usually
 not launched by hand but automatically, when choosing a LXQt session in the
 Display Manager.
